Neural networks have been used to create economic value through supervised learning.
Supervised learning involves mapping an input x to an output y.
Examples of applications of neural networks include online advertising, computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, and autonomous driving
Different types of neural networks are used for different applications, such as standard neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
Structured data refers to databases of data, while unstructured data refers to audio, images, and text.
Neural networks have transformed supervised learning and are creating tremendous economic value.

Note:
For example, in the real estate application that we saw in the previous video, we use a universally standard neural network architecture.
For image applications we'll often use convolutional neural networks, often abbreviated CNN.
And for sequence data. So for example, audio has a temporal component, Audio is played out over time, so audio is most naturally represented as a one-dimensional time series or as a one-dimensional temporal sequence. And so for sequence data, you often use an RNN, a recurrent neural network. 
Language, English and Chinese, the alphabets or the words come one at a time. So language is also most naturally represented as sequence data. And so more complex versions of RNNs are often used for these applications. And then, for more complex applications, like autonomous driving, where you have an image, that might suggest more of a CNN, convolution neural network,
