Deep learning has been around for decades, but is only now taking off.
The main drivers behind the rise of deep learning are the amount of data available and the ability to train large neural networks.
The amount of data available has increased due to the digitization of society and the rise of inexpensive cameras, accelerometers, and other sensors.
The ability to train large neural networks has been enabled by faster computation, such as GPUs and faster networking.
Algorithmic innovation has also been a factor, such as switching from sigmoid to RELU functions, which has made gradient descent work faster.
Faster computation has allowed practitioners and researchers to iterate faster and improve ideas faster.
Data, computation, and algorithms are still working powerfully to make deep learning even better.
