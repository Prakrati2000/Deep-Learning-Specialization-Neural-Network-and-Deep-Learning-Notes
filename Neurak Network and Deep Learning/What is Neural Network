Deep Learning refers to training Neural Networks, sometimes very large Neural Networks.
A Neural Network is a function that takes an input (x) and outputs a prediction (y).
An example of a Neural Network is a Housing Price Prediction model, which takes the size of a house as an input and outputs the estimated price.
The function used in this example is called a ReLU (rectified linear unit) function, which goes to zero and then takes off as a straight line.
A larger Neural Network is formed by stacking together many single neurons.
An example of a larger Neural Network is one that takes four inputs (size, number of bedrooms, zip code, wealth of the neighborhood) and outputs the estimated price.
Neural Networks are most useful in supervised learning, where an input (x) is mapped to an output (y).
